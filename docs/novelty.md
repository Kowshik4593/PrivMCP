# Novelty and Publication Readiness

## Chain-of-Thought and Explainability
- Every LLM answer includes a reasoning trace and, where possible, chain-of-thought explanations.

## Citations/Evidence RAG
- PubMed search is performed for clinical and literature queries.
- Citations are injected into the LLM response and reasoning trace.

## Clinical Report Synthesis
- For images, clinical report synthesis is performed (e.g., "No fracture seen", "Osteoporosis features").
- For audio, medical-grade transcription is used.

## Comparison with Prior Work
- See README for baseline comparisons and improvements.

## Visualization and Reasoning Trace
- Reasoning trace and explainability are included in every response.
