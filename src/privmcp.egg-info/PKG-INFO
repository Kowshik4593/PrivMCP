# PrivMCP: Multimodal Clinical Pipeline with Privacy, RAG, Audit, and Explainability

## System Overview
PrivMCP is an end-to-end clinical data pipeline that combines:
- **Multimodal input**: Accepts text, images (e.g., x-rays), and audio (e.g., dictations).
- **Privacy**: PHI redaction, differential privacy for numeric data, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) access control.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Injects live PubMed citations into LLM responses for evidence-backed answers.
- **Auditability**: Every query and response is logged with a reasoning trace for compliance and review.
- **Explainability**: Each output includes a chain-of-thought reasoning trace, model details, and evidence links.

## Key Features
- **LLM Output**: Uses Groq API for real, high-quality LLM completions.
- **Evidence Injection**: Fetches and cites PubMed articles relevant to the query.
- **Clinical Captioning**: Images are captioned with BLIP2 using a clinical prompt; audio is transcribed with Whisper.
- **Audit Log**: All queries, responses, and reasoning traces are appended to a downloadable audit log.
- **Reasoning Trace**: JSON output includes prompt, PHI, DP, ZKP, citations, model used, and explainability notes.

## Comparison to Prior Work
Unlike prior systems, PrivMCP:
- Supports real multimodal input (image/audio/text) in a single pipeline.
- Provides evidence-backed LLM responses with live PubMed RAG.
- Integrates privacy (DP, ZKP, PHI redaction) and audit logging by default.
- Outputs a full reasoning trace for every answer, supporting explainability and compliance.

See `docs/novelty.md` for more details on novelty and publication readiness.
